              <li>
                Determine the customer's installation situation and needs: For
                example, what version and year of QuickBooks is the customer
                installing, and how many workstations will be installed?

                Determine if the customer has a One Intuit Account setup and

              <li>
                Determine if the product the customer purchased is linked to

              <li>
                Ensure the customer has Admin rights and the time needed to

              </li>
              <li>
                Confirm that the customer has downloaded QuickBooks Desktop or
                Desktop Manager if needed and saved the files somewhere they can
                easily find them (like their Windows desktop).
              </li>
              <li>
